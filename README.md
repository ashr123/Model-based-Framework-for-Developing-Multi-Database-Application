# Model-based-Framework-for-Developing-Multi-Database-Application
## Things to improve:
- Implement connection pool grouped by fieldsMapping for enabling lazy fetching (for keeping the connection alive).
- Adding more DBs such as Cassandra, Redis...
- Improve ACID.
- Introduce more ways to connect to the DBs (because pretty much everyone allows connection through url (acts as server), embedded, in-memory). 
- Improve performance.
